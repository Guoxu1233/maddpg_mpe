# MADDPG-PyTorch
This is a PyTorch Implementation of MADDPG from [*Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed
Cooperative-Competitive Environments*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275) 

## Requirements

Conda environment is the same as my [ma diffusion](https://github.com/Guoxu1233/madiffusion_mpe)

## How to Run

All training code is contained within `main.py`. 

```
python main.py
```
